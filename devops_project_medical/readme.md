### Example Project - Domain: Medical
A hospital wishes to implement a system which can detect harmful drug interactions. They want a mobile phone application which allows doctors to enter or scan prescriptions. The system will then check for drug interactions. Any conflicting drugs will be highlighted so that the prescription can be changed. You will need to design, implement and deploy part of the application.
