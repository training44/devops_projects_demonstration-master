# DevOps Demo Projects

Here is a curated list of DevOps Projects to be deployed via Jenkins:

```
 * Devops Pipeline Demo
 * Example Project - Domain: Finance
 * Example Project - Domain: Media
 * Example Project - Domain: Medical
```
Create separate Jenkins jobs for each of the above as per the respective settings mentioned in the readme files present in the designated subdirectories meant for these tasks. All the best! :+1:.

PROBLEM STATEMENT(S): 

### Devops Pipeline Demo

* Build a Pipeline to resolve the issues in the management, development and operations of product release for a social media company using continuous deployment to break down the barrier and automate everything.

* Integrate Jenkins with GitHub in such a way that committing a change to the repository, the build should be triggered automatically

* Create a Jenkins freestyle project to perform code review

* Create a Pipeline View

* Unit Test

* Generate Cobertura Code Coverage Report

* Create a Package and archive the artifacts

* Deploy the project by copying the artifacts from the Package

* Configure Jenkins to connect to Docker container port

* Run the Pipeline



### Example Project - Domain: Finance
A global bank recruits 500 graduate software developers each year. The developers are employed at sites in 4 different countries. The bank requires a web-based questionnaire system to assess graduatesâ€™ programming skills so that they can provide appropriate training. You will need to design, implement and deploy part of the system.

### Example Project - Domain: Media
A media company wishes to offer a website where users can upload photographs. Captions and titles can be added to the photographs. Customers can order prints of photos on T-shirts, mugs, and other items. You will need to design, implement and deploy part of the system.

### Example Project - Domain: Medical
A hospital wishes to implement a system which can detect harmful drug interactions. They want a mobile phone application which allows doctors to enter or scan prescriptions. The system will then check for drug interactions. Any conflicting drugs will be highlighted so that the prescription can be changed. You will need to design, implement and deploy part of the application.
